          <p>When you wake up in the morning, did you ever worried about something? Did you worried about any physiological needs (food, water, etc), safety or you worried about something else?. The answer shows you what kind of life you live in. This is related to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory. There should be one out of five needs that you care or worried about. Those are Physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem and self-actualization.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">source : simplypsychology.org</span>

          <p>There are 3 big categories from it those are basic needs, psychological needs (different with physiological needs) and self-fulfillment needs</p>

          <p>I might not the right person to interpret it, but when something happens and everyone has a different response to it I always remember this theory. Just look at what happened in our country recently. When coronavirus infected a lot of people in Indonesia especially in Jakarta and the government told us to do social distancing or self-isolation a lot of people responded in a different way. </p>

          <p>There are a couple of people who can do so because their physiological needs already fulfilled and they can stay at home and doing their work from home. We are not talking people who actually are able to do their work from home but they still going to the office because it’s the company policy. Let’s talk about people who can’t stay or work from home because they can’t do their work from home like online taxi drivers and etc.</p>

          <p>Don’t they care about their safety when they have to go outside every day in these kinds of situations?. Maybe they care. But they more care about their physiological needs. They have to fulfill it first then they can care about something else. A person said: <blockquote class="blockquote">“I have to go work today because of the money that I got today I spend today“.</blockquote></p>

          <p>If I  might talk about something more political, why money politic still happens a lot in Indonesia. The answer may be because a lot of people still struggling to fulfill their basic needs, especially physiological needs. As long as it doesn't fulfill yet, they can’t think or care about something else. They can’t think about what happens to their city or their country in the next 5 years because they care more about what they are going to eat tomorrow or the next couple of days. So don’t blame them because they accept the money, because if you are in their situation you might do the same things.</p>

          <p>Just remember, we are always going to needs and/or worried about something. But as long as what you need and worry is no longer about your basic needs. Just be grateful for it. Thank you.</p>
